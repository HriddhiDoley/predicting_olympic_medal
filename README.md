# Predicting Olympic Medals
## Goal 
Explore Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning techniques to predict the number of Olympic medals a country will win. Build and evaluate different models to understand which factors are most influential in predicting Olympic success.

## Findings and Insights 

* Neural Network Performance: 
       ** The Neural Network outperformed all traditional models, achieving the lowest MAE (5.62) and MSE (57.17).
       ** It demonstrated its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the 
dataset. 

* Traditional Models: 
       ** Linear Regression:
            *** Performed the worst, with the highest MAE (8.98) and MSE (104.58).
            *** The inability to model non-linear relationships led to subpar performance. 

* Decision Tree:
          *  Showed slightly better results than Linear Regression but suffered from overfitting, reflected in high MSE (127.89). 

* Random Forest:
          * Performed better than both Linear Regression and Decision Tree with MAE (8.06), showcasing its strength in handling feature interactions. 

* General Observations:
          *  RÂ² values for all models were negative, indicating poor goodness-of-fit. This suggests the presence of non-linear patterns in the data that traditional models 
struggled to capture effectively. 

## Feature Importance 
**Top Features:** 

* Sports Index (sports_index) and Olympics Index (olympics_index):
      * Strongly correlated with total medals, making them critical predictors. 

* GDP and Population: 
      * Weak individual correlations with total medals, but their interaction term 
(gdp_population_interaction) may provide additional predictive value. 

**Neural Network:** 
* Able to leverage the combined influence of all features, including non-linear interactions, 
to achieve superior performance. 

## Conclusion 
**1. Key Takeaway:**
* Neural Networks are highly effective in capturing non-linear relationships and 
interactions, making them the most suitable model for predicting total Olympic 
medals. 
* Traditional models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees struggled due to 
their inability to model complex patterns. 
**2. Importance of Features:** 
* Sports-related indices (sports_index and olympics_index) are crucial for 
predicting medal counts. 
* Economic indicators (e.g., GDP, population) contribute indirectly, primarily 
through interaction terms. 
## Future Work 
**1. Feature Engineering:** 
* Explore additional interaction terms and non-linear transformations to improve 
model accuracy.
* Incorporate other potential features, such as historical performance data or 
sports funding.

**2. Hyperparameter Tuning:** 
  * Optimize the Neural Network architecture (e.g., number of layers, neurons, 
activation functions). 
* Fine-tune parameters for Decision Tree and Random Forest to mitigate 
overfitting.

**3. Cross-Validation:**
  * Use K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure robust evaluation and minimize bias in 
model performance. 

**4. Advanced Models:**
* Experiment with more sophisticated models like Gradient Boosting Machines 
(e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost). 
* Test convolutional networks for data involving spatial or temporal patterns. 

**5. Scalability:**
* Extend the analysis to include data from more countries and additional Olympic 
years to validate model performance across diverse contexts.
